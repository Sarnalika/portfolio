        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>The CEO and CMO were seeking actionable insights into the company's revenue trends, key customer performance, and geographical distribution of sales, as part of their strategic planning for future expansion. To address this, I took the following approach:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Using Python, specifically with the Pandas library, I cleaned the raw dataset to ensure that it was consistent and accurate. This included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing any outliers that might distort the analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Analysis:</strong> I created visualizations in Power BI that depicted the monthly revenue trends for 2011. This allowed us to identify seasonal patterns and track overall performance over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Top Countries Analysis:</strong> I excluded the UK to focus on other markets. By analyzing the data, I identified which countries were driving the most revenue and revealed key insights into the performance of different international markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Analysis:</strong> I pinpointed the top 10 customers by revenue, which helped the CEO and CMO understand which accounts were the most profitable and where the company’s strongest business relationships were.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographical Demand:</strong> By analyzing the sales data by region, I was able to visualize which areas had the highest demand for the company’s products, helping the leadership team target potential growth areas for expansion.</li>
        </ul>
