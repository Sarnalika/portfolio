        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The project aimed to build a **fake news detection system** using deep learning, specifically the **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model**. The goal was to train a model that could accurately classify news articles as **fake or real**, helping to combat misinformation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>With the rise of social media, **misinformation spreads rapidly**, impacting politics, health, and global events. Traditional rule-based detection methods are ineffective, necessitating **AI-driven solutions** to detect fake news in real-time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>The dataset consists of thousands of **real and fake news articles**, collected from various news sources. The dataset includes **textual features** such as headlines, article content, and sources. Preprocessing steps included tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preprocessed text data using **NLTK** and **TensorFlow/Keras**.</li>
                <li>Converted text into numerical representation using **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**.</li>
                <li>Trained an **LSTM-based deep learning model** for sequence learning.</li>
                <li>Optimized model parameters for **higher accuracy**.</li>
                <li>Deployed a **web-based interface** for real-time news classification.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The LSTM model achieved an accuracy of **~98%**, significantly improving fake news detection. The model can efficiently classify news articles and can be integrated into **news verification platforms**.</p>
