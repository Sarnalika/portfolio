        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this project was two-fold: to analyze customer feedback for British Airways and to build a predictive model to forecast customer bookings. Here's how it was achieved:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer Feedback Analysis:</strong> The first task was to scrape customer reviews from Skytrax, clean the collected data, and perform sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction. Additionally, topic modeling was conducted to uncover common themes and identify key factors influencing customer opinions.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> A predictive model was built using Python's <code>RandomForest</code> algorithm to forecast customer bookings based on historical data. The model's performance was evaluated through various metrics, and visualizations were created to highlight the key factors that influenced the predictions.</li>
        </ul>
