            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>This project aims to develop a weather prediction web app that forecasts temperature and humidity using live and historical weather data. The app provides city-specific insights, helping users make informed decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Accurate weather forecasting is essential for agriculture, travel, and disaster management. Traditional systems are often inaccurate or generalized for large regions. This project integrates real-time weather data with historical records to improve accuracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>The dataset consists of real-time weather data obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API and historical weather records. The dataset includes attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.</li>
                <li>Processed and cleaned the data using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.</li>
                <li>Trained machine learning models using Scikit-learn to predict temperature and humidity.</li>
                <li>Used a RandomForest model to improve prediction accuracy.</li>
                <li>Integrated predictions into a user-friendly web application.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The app successfully predicts temperature and humidity with high accuracy. The Rain Model achieved a **Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.1507**, making it a reliable tool for weather forecasting.</p>
