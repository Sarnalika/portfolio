        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this project is to enhance passenger safety at airports by improving visibility predictions in low-visibility conditions such as fog. Here's how this goal was addressed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> A dataset of 100 frames was extracted from footage recorded at Chicago Midway Airport during foggy conditions. These frames were processed using defogging and visibility enhancement algorithms to improve the clarity of the images.</li>
            <li><strong>Dataset Creation:</strong> A dataset was constructed with 1000 data points, comparing the calculated visibility (from the processed frames) and the measured visibility (from a real-world instrument). This dataset served as the foundation for training the predictive model.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> The model was trained using the dataset to predict future visibility conditions for a new runway. The goal was to provide an accurate forecast for visibility, which is critical for enhancing safety during low-visibility conditions like fog.</li>
        </ul>
